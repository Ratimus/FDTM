Gate inputs:
  Clock
  Reset
  Mod A
  Mod B

Gate Mod Tgts:
  clock src
  clock backward


Repetitor: per-track params:
 1 -Start Point
 2 -End Point
 3 -Step Offset
 4 -Clock Divide
 5 -Clock Skew
 6 -Track Jitter (probability step backward OR extra step fwd)
 Mask: per-track params:
 7 -Mask Mod 1 (euclidean fill; other modes probability )
 8 -Mask Mod 2 (offset)
 
idea: modes. in A/B mode, CV1 is the probability Pattern B will "fire."
  If combo logic is "Stomp," B will replace A whenever B is active, as
  per NE's confundowhateveris. BUT... we can select other Logic Modes.
  E.G if Logic is "OR" we will dial in B on top of A.
  If Logic is "NOT" we don't care what B is doing; we will invert A as we dial up

Global mod params:
w/CV offset:
  CV1: X-Fade / Euclidean: Global Fill / Stochastic: Global Probability / TM: prob. Bit flip
  CV2: Pattern A [re-assignable]
  CV3: 
  CV4: Track Swap [re-assignable]

raw CV in:
  CV5: Pattern B [re-assignable]
  CV6: Track 5 and 6 mod / factor [re-assignable]
  CV7: Track 7 and 8 mod / factor [re-assignable]
  CV8: [re-assignable]
=======================================
Trigger Outs:
Gate 1 through 4: [Pattern A or Pattern B via probability]
Gate 5 through 8: [Pattern A or Pattern B or Gates 1 - 4 or 0xFFFF] (Logic combine w/) [Euclidean or Turing]

Modes:
A = Pattern A ; B = Pattern B
A = Pattern A ; B = Mask
A = const rand; B = TM(A) . . . looks like Mask should be a latchable; mess it up but reset it to its original state
